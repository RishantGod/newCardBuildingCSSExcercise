## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learnt stuff from the last lesson, especially breaking down my code better. Going step by step is very important, atleast at this stage. So I made the background div and perfected that, then moved to the card, then to the image and finally to the text and name credit bit. I found it easier to solve problem this way. Also i learnt about shadow, which was very cool
